# SleepTimer

Test task sounds like: 

Write the application that allows the users to play a sound of nature and record audio when the sound is finished playing. You should provide your solution as a link to public repository on any git hosting service you prefer: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket. Please make commits of logical units, so we can evaluate your progress and add comments as you see fit.

!!! All Third-party Frameworks are restricted. Including SwiftLint, RxSwift, Swinject & so on
!!! Please, use ONLY Apple provider frameworks
!!! Highly welcome are SwiftUI, Combine 

### Further Details

Application should consists of one or two screens. On the main screen the users see state of the application: **idle**, **playing**, **recording**, **paused**; two controls that allow the users to choose duration of **sleep timer** in *minutes* and the **recording duration**; and the **play/pause** button.

The users set desired parameters, tap play button and application starts playing the sound of a nature during **sleep timer** duration in a loop. When the sound is finished, application starts recording audio. When recording time is finished, the application should transit back to **idle** state.  The recording should start in background mode as well, after the sound of nature is completed.

Tapping on **play/pause** should start the entire flow or pause playing or recording.

Everything should work in background as well. If the playing or recording is interrupted by another application using audio session, try to restore application state gracefully.

You should provide a way to switch off playing the sound of nature completely.

Audio records should be put in user **Documents** folder and be available via iTunes file sharing.

### Optional Requirements

- provide a way to switch off recording
- write tests

### Design Example

Here is an example how application might look like, but the final decision is up to you.

# P.S.
I have spent on this project 13 hours. Current version of project is not finished and needs complete.

I managed to finish:
- Clean Architecture + MVVM
- UI, Routing;
- Business logic for SleepTracker (consists of Player & Recorder);
- Interface and implementation of the Player (playing sound in the background).
- Recorder interface.

Remains to be completed:
- Implementation of the Recorder (the part that will be responsible for recording sound);
- FileReader (manager who will be responsible for saving records);
- Unit tests;
- Do bugfix.
